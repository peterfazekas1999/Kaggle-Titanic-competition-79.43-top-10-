# Kaggle-Titanic-competition-79.43%
This is my first competition in Kaggle, I have managed to achieve an accuracy of 79.43% which is in the top 10% of the competition. I have used early stopping for the model and tried a variety of values for the train_test split random_state so every time the model is trained it will lead to a slightly different submission accuracy. The best I have been able to achieve with this model architecture is 79.43%. I have included the Gridsearch function in the final code but I found that tweaking hyperparameters by hand worked better and furthermore hyperparameter search takes a long time.

and below is the model architecture built in Keras.
